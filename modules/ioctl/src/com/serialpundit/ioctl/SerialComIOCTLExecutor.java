/**
 * <p>Executes device-specific input/output operations and other operations which cannot be executed using 
 * regular system calls.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Application is expected to consult appropriate document to supply valid values to the methods as 
 * arguments and should understand what to expect by executing that particular IOCTL call. The IOCTL number 
 * (operation code) are unique to each driver and must be obtained from them.</p>
 * 
 * Following are typical use cases:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Access to GPIO pins in USB-UART, USB-HID, USB-I2C etc converters. It provide access to UART registers 
 * in the chip for example for reading the value at a particular port latch. The operating standard API for serial 
 * port communication provided by operating system generally does not have provision to explore modern facilities 
 * in USB-UART chip. The IOCTL calls helps in reading and writing to registers inside chip for example to configure 
 * a GPIO pin as digital output.
 * 
 * <p>It should be noted that the USB-UART bridge generally have one time programmable memory 
 * and therefore configuration/customization settings must be done thoughtfully either programmatically 
 * or through vendor provided utility.</p></li>
