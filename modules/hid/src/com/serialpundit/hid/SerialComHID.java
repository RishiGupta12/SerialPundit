/**
 * <p>The SerialPundit provides two set of APIs for communicating with a HID device; raw mode API and 
 * parsed mode API. In raw mode, input reports received and output reports sent are not parsed. In 
 * parsed mode, input reports received and output reports sent are parsed. </p>
 * 
 * <p>In Windows, system supplied HID minidriver and HID class drivers provide most of the functionality 
 * and required support for HID-compliant devices. However we may have to write our own HID minidriver
 * if it is difficult to make desired changes to HID-compliant device firmware or if we need to make a 
 * non-HID compliant device into a HID device without updating the firmware.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that a driver can override the descriptors and reports from a HID device.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The SerialComRawHID class extends this class.</p>
