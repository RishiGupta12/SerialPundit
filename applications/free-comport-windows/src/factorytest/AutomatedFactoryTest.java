/*
 * This application suggest a design through which testing can be automated or may reduce the overhead 
 * on tester for testing products which requires test to be run after the DUT has been plugged into system.
 * 
 * 1. As soon as DUT with given USB VID/PID is added/removed in system, tests cases are made to execute.
 * When a particular number of devices for example 1000 has been tested, application will exit itself 
 * automatically.
 * 
 * 2. Further, if testing device is like USB-UART cable, it also demonstrates releasing COM port numbers 
 * assigned by Windows operating system automatically when the DUT testing has finished.
