The VCP drivers provided by Linux kernel does not explore all the features of CP210X 
USB-UART bridges. This document provides steps to build linux driver provided by Silicon 
labs outside linux kernel repository.

These steps must be executed on machine which will build and run the built driver. We 
tested with Ubuntu 12.04 with 3.11.0-20-generic kernel version.

1. Download and unpack Linux 3.x.x version of the driver from here :
https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx

2. Install kernel headers for your machine on which this driver is supposed to be run.
$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

3. Get the C source file corresponding to your kernel version. The line below is an example
   for 3.11.0-20-generic kernel version. 
$ wget https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/plain/drivers/usb/serial/cp210x.c?h=linux-3.11.y -O cp210x.c

4. Go to folder where you unpacked downloaded driver source files from silicon labs website.
   Rename file Makefile26 to Makefile.

5. Change PWD to directory and run configure script.
$ cd /--/--/your-path
$ ./configure

6. Issue make
$make

This will build driver in PWD directory.

make -C /lib/modules/3.11.0-20-generic/build -I /home/r/ws-host-uart/development/3-SILICON-LABS/custom-driver/cp210x-3.0.0/cp210x M=/home/r/ws-host-uart/development/3-SILICON-LABS/custom-driver/cp210x-3.0.0/cp210x modules
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.11.0-20-generic'
  CC [M]  /home/r/ws-host-uart/development/3-SILICON-LABS/custom-driver/cp210x-3.0.0/cp210x/cp210x.o
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST 1 modules
  CC      /home/r/ws-host-uart/development/3-SILICON-LABS/custom-driver/cp210x-3.0.0/cp210x/cp210x.mod.o
  LD [M]  /home/r/ws-host-uart/development/3-SILICON-LABS/custom-driver/cp210x-3.0.0/cp210x/cp210x.ko
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.11.0-20-generic'
r@r-office:~/ws-host-uart/development/3-SILICON-LABS/custom-driver/cp210x-3.0.0/cp210x$ 

7. When you insert CP210X device kernel will automatically load default drivers. So to use the driver
we built unload the driver loaded by kernel using modprobe.
$ modprobe -r cp210x

This will result in following output from dmesg:

[13767.939437] usbserial: USB Serial deregistering driver cp210x
[13767.939583] cp210x ttyUSB0: cp210x converter now disconnected from ttyUSB0
[13767.939597] usbcore: deregistering interface driver cp210x
[13767.939624] cp210x 3-4:1.0: device disconnected

8. Insert our driver module as root user.
# insmod /--/path to driver.ko

This will result in following output from dmesg:

[14320.865198] cp210x 3-4:1.0: cp210x converter detected
[14320.977521] usb 3-4: reset full-speed USB device number 14 using xhci_hcd
