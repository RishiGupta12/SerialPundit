# When a FTDI device is connected to system linux kernel with udev tries to load appropriate VCP 
# driver for connected device. It is possible to just unbind default driver for a particular
# device using udev rules (see tools-and-utilities/99-sp-extra-udev.rules for unbinding with the 
# help of script).

# Input argument to this script is devpath for the device (udev rule %p).
