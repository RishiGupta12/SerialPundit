# Run this script as root user.

# When a CP210X device is connected to system linux kernel with udev tries to load appropriate VCP driver
# for connected device. If we do not want default driver, this script will unload default driver.

# Note that once the driver has been unloaded then if the device is un-plugged and plugged again into system
# default driver will get loaded again automatically by udev/kernel. So this script must be run each time
# USB-UART device is plugged into system.

set -e

modprobe -r cp210x

echo "default cp210x unloaded !"
