# Run this script as root user. Replace VID and PID with USB-IF VID and PID of your device. For example
# if VID is 0x0403 then VID=0403 should be used. The XXXX and YYYY are in hexadecimal format.

# Assume we changed the VID/PID of CP210X device. Now the Linux kernel driver has to be compiled with support
# for these VID/PID combinations added. But on a running kernel this might not be possible in addition to 
# other scenarios. We can dynamically make existing driver serve this device by associating VID/PID with
# the driver with the help of new_id sysfs file.

# Also this is not limited to cp210x devices but can be used with any usb-serial driver.

VID=XXXX
PID=YYYY
