# This script makes it possible to change the latency timer's value from user space application.
# It change the permissions of latency timer file (sysfs entry) to read/write for all. Setting low 
# timer value may be beneficial for frequent I/O while setting high values may be beneficial for bulk 
# transfer.

# The default drivers in Linux kernel may not allow to change (ignore) timer value or the sysfs file
# itself may not exist. So it is required that either we need to write our own driver for this purpose
# or use drivers provided by FTDI at their website.

# An example sysfs file for latency timer is :
# /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-3/3-3:1.0/ttyUSB0/tty/ttyUSB0/device/latency_timer

# To see what are the environment variables set by udev redirect 'env' value and open spudevenv.txt 
# file in text editor to see list of variables and their values.
# env >> /tmp/spudevenv.txt

# Input argument ($1) to this script is devpath for the device (udev rule %p).

chmod 0666 "/sys$1/device/latency_timer"
