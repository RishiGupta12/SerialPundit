# This is a udev rule file for all devices from Silicon Labs with VID 0x10C4 (not specific to any
# Silicon Labs product (USB PID)). Place this file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ for Ubuntu Linux distro.

# These rules will grant read and write access to all users, include non-privileged users, for all 
# USB devices that have a matching Vendor ID according to the rules below. If required, more 
# restrictions on access to these devices can be achieved. Please learn more about writing udev 
# rules for putting more restrctions. It is possible to set up a group or user owner for accessing 
# a specific device.

# This file can be renamed as per the requirement. After putting it in /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory 
# udev need not be restarted. Just un-lug or plug the device in USB port again. Also vendor ID and 
# Product ID may be case sensitive. Please use dmesg to check device information when device is 
# plugged in system. System supplied default rules are generally placed in /lib/udev/rules.d and gets
# overridden by rules placed in /etc/udev/rules.d directory.

# We can also add user to dialout group if it is not member of dialout group.
# $groups YOURUSERNAME
# $sudo gpasswd --add YOURUSERNAME dialout
# Logout then login and then insert the USB-UART device.

# It may be required to reload udev rules if the udev rule file is added in running system.
# $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
# $ sudo udevadm trigger --attr-match=subsystem=tty
